Product Description: 
Our overall idea is to have a website (with accompanying app) that is a social media type app. The differences that set it apart is, that the entire focus is the connection of profesionals, coperations and everyday people through food and the photography of it. Essentially, our website will be a place where people can
share anything and everything about food (pictures, recipes, restaurants, reviews,
dinning experiences and more). The basis is to let people have the ability to, create a profile, connect with old freinds and new people,  through "the dinning experience". They can share there "experience" with comments, recipes and "likes" through the pictures they post. This will allow culinary professionals, fine dinning resturants, "foddies" and everyday people to connect through there "dinning experience"
